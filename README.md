Documentation for your project in the form of a Markdown file called README.md. This documentation is to be a userâ€™s manual for your project. Though the structure of your documentation is entirely up to you, it should be incredibly clear to the staff how and where, if applicable, to compile, configure, and use your project. Your documentation should be at least several paragraphs in length. It should not be necessary for us to contact you with questions regarding your project after its submission. Hold our hand with this documentation; be sure to answer in your documentation any questions that you think we might have while testing your work.

Project Title: Traveler

The Vision! - To start off, the purpose of our website is mainly a travel planning website with a special feature, currency converter! Our original idea was to have just a curency converter but then we realized we can do so much more! We knew our website would at least have a sign in/sign up page where users can track their account balance and how much money they converted. Our "best" outcome ideas were to have a budgetting spreadsheet page and also a page where users can look for the nearest ATM with the best exchange rates in a foreign country.

How it works: Our website can be run on CS50.dev.

How to Use!
1)Create an Account
2)Log in to your account
