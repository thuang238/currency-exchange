# Currency Exchange

The Vision! - To start off, the purpose of our website is mainly a travel planning website with a special feature, currency converter! Our original idea was to have just a curency converter but then we realized we can do so much more! We knew our website would at least have a sign in/sign up page where users can track their account balance and how much money they converted. Our "best" outcome ideas were to have a budgetting spreadsheet page and also a page where users can look for the nearest ATM with the best exchange rates in a foreign country.

How it works: Our website can be run on CS50.dev which is Harvard's enterprise version of Github. Our next steps are to expand this project, so it can be viewed by users outside of the Harvard domain. Take a look at our view to see our website! :)
